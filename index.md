## Azure Tests

I needed to study Azure cloud technologies for my workplace, so while I was making progress I created a GitHub "study" to share my steps.
As a first step I just planning to cover some basic tasks, such as creating "Hello World" application in all different forms. Then develope these solutions a bit further by adding more complex technologies.

### Useful pages
